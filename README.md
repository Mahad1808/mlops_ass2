# Data Preprocessing Steps Documentation
## Overview
Data preprocessing is an essential step in preparing raw data for analysis or modeling. It involves cleaning, transforming, and organizing data to make it suitable for further processing.

## Steps
### Removing HTML Tags:
HTML tags are removed from the text using regular expressions to eliminate any markup language present in the data.
### Tokenization:
The text is tokenized into individual words or tokens to break down the text into its component parts.
Removing Stopwords:
Stopwords, which are common words that do not contribute much to the meaning of the text, are removed to reduce noise in the data.
### Lemmatization:
Words are lemmatized to convert them into their base or root form, reducing inflectional forms to a common base.
### Implementation
The preprocessing steps are implemented using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library in Python. The NLTK library provides functions for tokenization, stopwords removal, and lemmatization, making it suitable for text preprocessing tasks.

## DVC Setup Documentation
### Overview
Data Version Control (DVC) is a tool for managing and versioning data in machine learning projects. It allows for efficient storage, sharing, and tracking of data files and associated metadata.

## Setup Steps
### Installation:
DVC is installed using pip, optionally with additional plugins such as dvc[gdrive] for integration with Google Drive.
### Initialization:
A new DVC project is initialized in the desired directory using the dvc init command.
### Google Drive Integration:
Google Drive is configured as a remote storage for DVC using the dvc gdrive init command. This involves authenticating with Google Drive and specifying the folder where data will be stored.
### Remote Addition:
The Google Drive remote is added to the DVC project using the dvc remote add command, specifying the remote name and the Google Drive folder ID or path.
### Data Management:
Data files are added to DVC using the dvc add command, and changes are committed with dvc commit. Data is pushed to Google Drive using dvc push.
## Implementation
The DVC setup is implemented using command-line interface (CLI) commands in the terminal. The configuration details, such as remote storage and data file paths, are managed through these commands to ensure proper integration with Google Drive and version control of the data files.

## Brief Report
### Workflow
#### Data Extraction:
Data is extracted from sources such as news websites using web scraping techniques.
Links, titles, and descriptions are extracted from the HTML content of the web pages.
#### Data Preprocessing:
Extracted text data is preprocessed to remove HTML tags, tokenize text, remove stopwords, and lemmatize words.
Preprocessing is performed using the NLTK library in Python.
#### Data Storage and Version Control:
Processed data is stored in a dedicated folder within the project directory.
DVC is used for version control, with Google Drive configured as a remote storage location.
Changes to the data are tracked and committed using DVC commands, ensuring accurate versioning.
Challenges Encountered
#### Google Drive Integration:
Configuring DVC to work with Google Drive required authentication and authorization steps, which were initially unfamiliar but resolved with the help of documentation and online resources.
#### Workflow Integration:
Integrating data extraction, preprocessing, and version control into a seamless workflow required careful planning and coordination to ensure smooth execution of each step.
